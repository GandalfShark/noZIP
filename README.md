noZIP is a simple script to generate a list of over 6000 possible malicous .zip domains and redirect them to the loopback
While this isn't the best solution it can hopefully help with some common filenames being registered as .zip domains and being 
used to direct users to potentially dangerous websites. As allways, educating users is best practice. We can not anticipate all possible names
and blocking all .zip and .mov adresses is a better option than this script.
